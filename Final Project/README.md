Teammates: Jason Li

Problem Definition
Give a concise description of current problem. What needs to be solved? Why is the result useful? Do you make any assumptions? What are the anticipated difficulties?

Method and Implementation
Give a concise description of the implemented method. For example, you might describe the motivation of your idea, the algorithmic steps of your methods, or the mathematical formulation of your method.

Results
List your experimental results. Provide examples of input images and output images. If relevant, you may provide images showing any intermediate steps. If your work involves videos, do not submit the videos but only links to them.

Discussion
Discuss your method and results:

What are the strengths and weaknesses of your method?

Do your results show that your method is generally successful or are there limitations? Describe what you expected to find in your experiments, and how that differed or was confirmed by your results.

Potential future work. How could your method be improved? What would you try (if you had more time) to overcome the failures/limitations of your work?

Conclusions
Based on your discussion, what are your conclusions? What is your main message?

Questions

1. Which styles does the network work on? Which fail?
2. Does the method work equally well on all faces?
3. What are good quantitative metrics for evaluating this?

Credits and Bibliography
Cite any papers or other references you consulted while developing your solution. Citations to papers should include the authors, the year of publication, the title of the work, and the publication information (e.g., book name and publisher; conference proceedings and location; journal name, volume and pages; technical report and institution).
